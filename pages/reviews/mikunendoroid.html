        I have many Miku Nendoroids, but I didn't have the original one. So, I decided to change that! I bought her from a mfc user:the Hatsune Miku 2.0 Nendoroid!
        <br><br>
        I decided to get the 2.0 version instead of her predecessor, mostly because the 2.0 version comes with more accessories and looks better.
        <br><br>
        She was second-hand and listed as 'great condition'. I don't mind buying figures second-hand. In fact, almost all of the figures I own are second-hand! Anyways, let get into her packaging and box!
        <br><br>
        Her box is bigger than most recent nendoroid boxes are today! (Note: I already took her out of the blister after realizing that I forgot to take pictures -_-)

        <br><br>

        <div class="imgwrap">
            <a href="/images/figures/miku2.0/front.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/images/figures/miku2.0/resized/front.jpg"></a>
            <a href="/images/figures/miku2.0/back.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/images/figures/miku2.0/resized/back.jpg"></a>
        </div>
        <div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-around;">
            <div>Front</div>
            <div>Back</div>
        </div>

        <br>

        Taking her out of the box shows that she comes with many accessories!

        <br><br>

        <br><br>

        Time to start assembling her! Umm... I broke one of the hair pegs when trying to change her hair...

        <br><br>

        It's a big problem with older Nendoroids. The parts become brittle and break easily. Fortunately I can buy spare Nendoroid parts from <a href="https://chibichopshop.com/" target="_blank">Chibi Chop Shop</a> so it wasn't a big deal for me! Don't make the same mistake as me and carefully apply parts!
        <br><br>
        It was difficult deciding how exactly I wanted to pose her! I ultimately went with her sitting down pose so I could display her on my computer desk!

        <br><br>

        <br><br>

        She's absolutely adorable! This may be one of my favorite Miku Nendoroids!
        <br><br>
        Here she is, chilling next to Kyo!

        <br><br>

        And finally, here she is on my computer desk! I hope my cat doesn't knock her down...

        <br><br>

        All in all, I really love her! I especially like that she comes with so many accessories. Nendoroids nowadays cost $50-$60 and come with very little. Miku's original price was $30 and she comes with so much!
        <br><br>
        I also really appreciate the fact that she comes with a sitting down pose! Nendoroids are impossible to sit down, so this was a pleasant surprise!
