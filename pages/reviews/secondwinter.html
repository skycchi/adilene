        This is a figure I've wanted for quite a long time! When I began collecting in 2019, I saw her - the Hatsune Miku 2nd Season Winter figure! She was absolutely adorable and I had to have her. Unfortunately she was sold out, and I didn't know how to obtain figures second-hand just yet. She sat at the back of my mind semi-forgotten until the end of last year. She was getting a rerelease! I immediately pre-ordered her and waited patiently for her to arrive. Let's look at her now that we finally have her!

            <a href="/images/figures/secondwinter/back.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/images/figures/secondwinter/resized/back-min.jpg"></a>

        I love the colors used for the box! Her illustration is as adorable as I thought it would be! Let's take her out of her box (free her)!

        I didn't expect for the halo to be separated from her body, to be quite honest. It makes sense though, haha. Let's further free her and begin assembling!

        <br><br>

        <div class="imgwrap">
            <a href="/images/figures/secondwinter/full.jpeg" target="_blank"><img src="/images/figures/secondwinter/resized/full-min.jpeg"></a>
            <a href="/images/figures/secondwinter/fullback.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/images/figures/secondwinter/resized/fullback-min.jpg"></a>
        </div>

        <br>

        Her halo was difficult to put in correctly, but the figure itself does not disappoint! What else can I say other than: she's so cute! The paint job was excellent, her face is adorable, her outfit, her colors... Ah!!!

        Here are some closeups of some of her details! 10/10!

        To end this, I'll admit that I almost cancelled my preorder. I've been trying to collect less prize figures and invest in more pricy but detailed scale figures. I'm glad I didn't do so! She was as cute as I first imagined in 2019. She might be one of my last prize figures, but I'm happy I ended my prize figure saga with a bang!
