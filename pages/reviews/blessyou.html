        On to the third Miku figure from my haul: the Hatsune Miku Project Diva Arcade Future Tone SPM Bless You figure! Don't even get me started...<br><br>
        I've always thought the outfit for this module was very cool! This figure was another one of my SPM wish list.

        <br><br>

        <div class="imgwrap">
            <a href="/images/figures/bless/front.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/images/figures/bless/resized/front.jpg"></a>
            <a href="/images/figures/bless/side.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/images/figures/bless/resized/side.jpg"></a>
        </div>
        <div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-around;">
            <div>Front</div>
            <div>Sides</div>
        </div>

        <br>

        The box features a posing miku! The sides are a simple white, yet very detailed!
        <br><br>
        Taking her out of the box reveals that she's unassembled.

        <br><br>

        Time to start assembling! Here she is in full!

        <br><br>

        <div class="imgwrap">
            <a href="/images/figures/bless/full.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/images/figures/bless/resized/full.jpg"></a>
            <a href="/images/figures/bless/fullback.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/images/figures/bless/resized/fullback.jpg"></a>
        </div>

        <br>
        She's an absolutely great figure! Her gradient paint job, her sculpt, everything is well done! I especially love her pose, it's so unique!
        <br><br>
        Her base features diamonds. It's plain, yet it suits the figure! I do wish it was smaller though... I dislike large bases.
        <br><br>
        Her outfit is so cool! I love the ruffles! Here is a close up of her flower headpiece! It's very detailed!

        <br><br>

        The only complaint I have is that two of her skirt ribbons are bent, which it's... not supposed to be. I guess they bent in the packaging. Oh well, couldn't be avoided. :(
        <br><br>
        Overall, she is one of my favorite SPM figures! I hope they make more unique SPM figures such as this one. Here she is on my manga shelf next to the Infinity SPM!
