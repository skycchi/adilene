        <header>FURYU - NOODLE STOPPER FIGURE - SAILOR SUIT IN LOVE</header>
        Original release date: 6.28.22<br>
        Date obtained: 10.21.22<br>
        Obtained from: Tokyo Otaku Mode<br><br>
        When I first saw her, I knew I had to have her. Hatsune Miku? Check. Noodle stopper? Check. Trans colors? Check!!!<br><br>
        Although I generally dislike ordering from Tokyo Otaku Mode, I decided to buy her on there because I had a birthday coupon and points to spare. Yet this meant a long wait due to TOM's infamous delays... But now, seven months later, she is in my hands! Let's get a look at her packaging!<br><br>
        <a href="https://adilene.neocities.org/reviews/figures/sailor/package.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://adilene.neocities.org/reviews/figures/sailor/resized/package-min.jpg"></a>
        <br><br>
        The package was a lot smaller than I was expecting. It was packaged very well though so that's a plus. Let's get a better look at the box!<br><br>

            <a href="https://adilene.neocities.org/reviews/figures/sailor/right.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://adilene.neocities.org/reviews/figures/sailor/resized/right-min.jpg"></a>
        </div>
        <div style="display:flex;justify-content: space-around;">
            <div>Front</div>
            <div>Left</div>
            <div>Right</div>
        </div><br>
        I absolutely love the box design! I might be biased because my favorite colors are blue and pink, but it's just so cute! The art is especially adorable! I love how the zero is a heart on her left shoulder. It's a great attention to detail, especially for a prize figure. And judging by the pictures on the box, the figure translated very well from the art. But anyway, let's open the box.<br><br>
        Upon opening the box and pulling out the clamshell, something I didn't expect at all fell out. It was a postcard of the figure art!<br><br>
        <div class="imgwrap">
            <a href="https://adilene.neocities.org/reviews/figures/sailor/cardfront.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://adilene.neocities.org/reviews/figures/sailor/resized/cardfront-min.jpg"></a>
            <a href="https://adilene.neocities.org/reviews/figures/sailor/cardback.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://adilene.neocities.org/reviews/figures/sailor/resized/cardback-min.jpg"></a>
        </div>
        <div style="display:flex;justify-content: space-around;">
            <div>front</div>
            <div>back</div>
        </div><br>
        I do believe this is one of the first times a postcard has been included together with a prize figure. At the very least, I don't think I've ever really seen this done. An appreciated surprise nonetheless! I didn't know where to put it though so I left it in the box for now. Let's get a look at the actual figure now!<br><br>
        <div class="imgwrap">

        She has the general prize figure flaws, some sloppy painting in some parts, and a poor hair sculpt, but she's so cute! She's also exceptionally tiny, which explains the small box size. I don't mind this at all though! Her tiny size goes well with her theme of a shy young school girl.<br><br>
        Her outfit, the details, the colors, what is there not to love? Overall I think she's my favorite noodle stopper thus far! I can't wait to see other unique Miku designs in the future. Here she is sitting on my shelf next to her sisters.<br><br>
