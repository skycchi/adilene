        I finally decided to get something that has been on my wishlist for a while: the Hatsune Miku Project Diva Arcade Future Tone SPM Pierretta figure! Quite a long name...
        <br><br>
        SPM figures usually go for around $20-$25, but this particular seems to be more popular than I thought, going for about $30-$50. Even so, I managed to snag her for $25 plus shipping from a store I've never bought from before. Buying figures from new stores is always a gamble, but it's a gamble I'm willing to take!
        <br><br>
        Anyways, let's start with the packaging! As this was the first time I've ordered from GalacticToys, I wasn't sure what to expect with the packaging. So when I received the package and saw that the box was dented, I was filled with a bit of dread.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        Ok... Not too bad I guess. Don't know what they were thinking, wrapping the figure box in the loosest bubblewrap possible. Though I won't judge too harshly; it may have come undone in the shipping process. Always make sure to secure the bubblewrap folks!
        <br><br>
        Let's look at the box!
        <br><br>

            <a href="https://adilene.neocities.org/reviews/figures/pierretta/left.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://adilene.neocities.org/reviews/figures/pierretta/resized/left.jpg"></a>
            <a href="https://adilene.neocities.org/reviews/figures/pierretta/right.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://adilene.neocities.org/reviews/figures/pierretta/resized/right.jpg"></a>
        </div>
        <div style="display:flex;justify-content: space-around;">
            <div>front</div>
            <div>left</div>
            <div>right</div>
        </div>
        <br>
        This has got to be one of the most perfect boxes I've ever received. By that, I mean that there are no dents or imperfections anywhere. Quite surprising to see, considering how the box was packaged!
        <br><br>
        The box is really nice! I like the carnival-like feel it has to it! The left side features the in-game Pierretta module, which I think adds a nice touch to the box.
        <br><br>
        Opening the box shows that she doesn't come in a blister, which I hate. Miku is also in pieces.

        She was a bit difficult to put together. Her upper body would just not go into her lower body. -_- Here she is, put together!

        She's so cute! The pose, the clothes, the colors... Overall a fantastic Miku module! What I love about SPM figures is that they're quite cheap, yet contain the details a scale figure would! They're also quite big as well! This figure is no exception! Her base is quite nice as well. It fits her theme quite well!

        One thing that I noticed while putting her together are these weird clear stains and small scratches. Here is one of the clear stains, shown in her bangs.

        <br><br>
        These errors aren't very noticeable if you're not looking closely, but they're still there. It's not much of a bother to me, but I do like my figures to be defectless.
        <br><br>
        Overall, she's another well done SPM figure! I'll be ordering more spm figures in the future! I put her next to my Ribbon Girl SPM figure.
