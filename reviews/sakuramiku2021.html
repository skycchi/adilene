        <!--- sakura miku 2021 --->
        <header>TAITO - SAKURA MIKU - 2021 VERSION</header>
        Original release date: 2.20.21<br>
        Date obtained: 7.31.21<br>
        Obtained from: Tokyo Otaku Mode<br><br>
        After waiting for months, she's finally here: the Sakura Miku 2021 version! I have the previous years' Sakura Mikus, so I was anxiously waiting for this one! Unfortunately, TOM tends to ship out their figures months after the original release date, so I had to wait 5 months to receive her... That's the last time I'm ordering from TOM!
        <br><br>
        Let's start with her packaging! TOM always packages their items well!

        <br><br>
        Haha... Why is the bubble wrap kind of loose at the bottom? The box is fine, right?<br><br>

        <br>
        ...It's dented on the top. Thanks TOM! :D
        <br><br>
        Box-denting aside, let's look at the actual box:<br><br>

        This is my favorite Sakura Miku box yet! The sakuras and the sky behind Miku really sell the figure well! The illustration is beautiful as well!
        <br><br>
        Opening the box shows that Miku is in a blister, with her twin-tails separated from her head. A flower is present, which goes in her hand. Here she is, fully assembled:
        <br><br>
        <a href="https://adilene.neocities.org/reviews/figures/sakuramiku2021/full.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://adilene.neocities.org/reviews/figures/sakuramiku2021/resized/full.jpg"></a>
        <br><br>
        The first thing i noticed after assembling her is that her right leg peg wouldn't fully go into the base.
        <br><br>
        <a href="https://adilene.neocities.org/reviews/figures/sakuramiku2021/peg.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://adilene.neocities.org/reviews/figures/sakuramiku2021/resized/peg.jpg"></a>
        <br><br>
        I don't really mind this, but the fact that the peg won't fully go in may cause problems in the future. Namely, the peg could break if I apply any amount of force.
        <br><br>
        Moving on, I also noticed that Miku's color is a little darker than her box makes her out to be. Her box shows her as a light pastel pink, but in person she's more of a dusty rose. Not much of a problem, but putting her side by side with her former years' counterparts clearly show the color difference.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        The best part of the figure is her face. Her eyes are bright and very detailed, almost like a scale figure's!
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        I also really like the sakura she's holding! It adds so much to the figure! It can be removed if wanted, but she looks so much better with it!

        <br><br>
        Overall, this is definitely my favorite Sakura Miku so far. I can't wait to see what Taito gives us next year! I put her on the middle of my shelf:
